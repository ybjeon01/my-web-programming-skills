# Why I started this project?

I studied many programming skills such as OpenGL, operating system, and databases, but did not write down my own projects code that can be powerful weapons for my portfolio. The problem is that I have nothing to show, so I decided to track my work and learning to use the code I write here as portfolio.

# How I planned to achive the goal?

1. Make a sub goal such as 'make a blog' or 'watch a tutorial, code a code, learn form it' and write reasons to choose the sub goal or write what problems this code address.
2. make a small plan to achieve the goal.

    * plan what tools and features I need to study
    * ex: what backend, fronend tools I am going to use, what features I need to implement, and what I need to study to achieve the goal

3. study, summarize, and write a working code

    * Rather than describing how to use a tool, focus on why this tools should be used, what design pattern I used, and what concept is used to implement features
    * if what I am learning is related to another projects or features that I already learned, then leave reference links
    * write working code so other users can also run and experience.
    * write what problems I also encounterd while learning or coding
    * If necessary, make images, videos

4. evaluate my code

    * write which part of my plan was not right and could be better
    * predict what I can do after this goal

# Directory Structure

I think we write code becase we need to achieve what we want. We should not write code just because we like coding. So, Here I organize directory based on what the code is doing which is very relavant to goal of the code. There are three directories in this repository.

* fullstack-projects

    *  projects that involves frontend website interfaces and backend-related programs and codes so normal users who have access to web browser can have complete services without knowing what is hapenning under the hood.
    * examples: blog, social media, E-commerce, and etc.

* features

    * small features that can be involved into fullstack-projects
    * examples: cookies, authentication system, and etc.

* basics

    * knowledges that can be applied to any languages or libraries
    * this is not about how to use a library or languages, but about how things are implemented.
    * examples: what is async and awaits, how async feature is working in python or javascript, what is ORM, and etc.
